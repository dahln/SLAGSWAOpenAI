This repo/project was created during the [Salt Lake Azure User Group (SLAG) meeting on March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGcPVg_iaj4). This is the completed code that we built during the meeting. The code is ready to run or be deployed, but you need setup your own Azure Services (Azure OpenAI Service at a minimum - if you deploy it you will need to create your own Azure Static Web App). Once the OpenAI service is created, add the Endpoint and Key as environment variables.
